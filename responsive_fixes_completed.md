# Responsive Fixes for app.html - COMPLETED

## Tasks Completed:

- ✅ Optimized mobile styles for app cards (font sizes, spacing, text truncation)
- ✅ Enhanced modal responsiveness for different screen sizes
- ✅ Added proper mobile touch target improvements

## Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed**: CSS grid `repeat(5, 1fr)` that was overriding Bootstrap's responsive columns
2. **Added**: Responsive video styling with max-height constraints for different screen sizes
3. **Added**: Mobile-optimized font sizes and text truncation for app descriptions
4. **Enhanced**: Modal responsiveness with better sizing and spacing
5. **Improved**: Touch targets and spacing for mobile devices

## Responsive Breakpoints Added:
- 340px (extra small devices)
- 480px (small mobile)
- 576px (mobile)
- 768px (tablet)
- 992px+ (desktop)

## Next Steps:
- Test the responsive layout by opening app.html in browser
- Use browser developer tools to test different screen sizes
- Verify that Bootstrap grid system works properly
- Check mobile responsiveness on actual devices if possible
